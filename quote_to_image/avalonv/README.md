avalonv's python script to generate the images, taken from https://github.com/avalonv/literaryclock

Supposedly faster than the original php script, but when the same fonts are used (Libertine) it is 4 times slower (according to my measurements).

Usage:
- create virtualenv (run ./make_virtualenv.sh)
- activate it (source venv/bin/activate)
- run the script (./quote_to_image.py)
